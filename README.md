# 8Puzzle

This project was part of a third year university, Artificial Intelligence assignment for the Computer Science and Information Systems department.
This project utilises the Java Swing framework, at the time of creation I did not know of JavaFX and used JFormDesigner. I will update the project to JavaFX in the future.
The sound effects aren't always working correctly, probably because of the deprecated Java libraries I am using. This application does not work well on Windows with GUI so I have created a CLI version for Windows, works well with macOS and Linux.
